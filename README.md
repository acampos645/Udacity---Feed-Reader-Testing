# Feed Reader Testing Project
The purpose of this project was to use Jasmine.js testing to test a provided web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 

##Accessing App:
The application can be accessed by downloading the file from the following Github repository:

*[https://github.com/acampos645/Udacity---Feed-Reader-Testing.git](https://github.com/acampos645/Udacity---Feed-Reader-Testing.git)

Once the files have been downloaded, unzip them and open the index html file.  A feed of articles will be shown and the results of the Jasmine.js testing will be included at the the bottom of the page.

For details of each test run, you can view the code and comments at /Jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
